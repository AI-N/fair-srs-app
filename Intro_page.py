    #  About Fair-SRS demo:
    This is a demonstration for **Fair-SRS**, a Fair Session-based Recommendation System that 
    predicts userâ€™s next click based on their historical and current session sequences of click behaviour.
     Fair-SRS provides both personalized and diversified recommendations in two main steps: 

     1. forming user's session graph embeddings based on their long- and short-term interests, and

     2. computing the user's level of interest in diversity based on how similar are the items they recently clicked.

    In real-world scenarios, **users** tend to interact with more or less contents in different times and a good recommender system should know 
    when to surprise users by generating relevant diverse recommendations.
    In the other hand, **providers** expect to receive more exposure for their items regardless of their popularity, and this objective is important to be considered
    for the system to keep its providers satisfied and encourage them to stay in the system. 

    To achieve the objectives of both sides (users and providers), we propose Fair-SRS to optimize recommendations by
    making a trade-off between **accuracy** and **personalized diversity**. 
    A toy example and the main framework of Fair-SRS is shown below:
